I am software developer.

This blog is a collection of thoughts on my career as a developer. This will include stuff about my career, software and other related stuff.

This is not going to be some great work of prose but a haphazard collection of related ideas which will be helpful for me and maybe others.

I am using a template for this blog. I could do this blog from scratch, but I just wanted to get content out there. Plus I can write my posts in markdown rather than html!
