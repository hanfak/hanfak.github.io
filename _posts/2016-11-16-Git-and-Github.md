title: Git and Github

I remember having to create multiple versions of the same program in different files. It was kind of like having several different saved game files for the same game, just in case I wanted to go back and do things differently.

Git allows me to do this without having to create all these extra duplicate files (kind of like using the DRY principle).

Git is a type of version control, used in the creation of software. Yet it is also great for creating essays for school.

#### What is version control?

See here for a [great explanation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)
